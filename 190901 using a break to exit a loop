#20190901 Python Crash Course Chapter 7: using break to exit a loop (page 125)

#a break statements ends a while loop immediately without running remaining code
#run prompt, return input
prompt = "\nPlease enter the name of your favorite book:"
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you wish to end the program.)"
#make sure you use + (plus) and = (equal) as operands, not + (plus) and  -(minus)!!!

#create a while loop
while True:
    book = input(prompt)
    
    if book == 'quit':
        break
    else:
        print("I'd love to read " + book.title() + "!")
