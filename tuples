#Python Crash Course Chapter 4: Tuples page 69

#tuples allow for creating alist of items that CANNOT change (immutable = tuple)
#the difference between a tuple and a list is the use of () instead of []
#create a rectangle that doesn't change size
dimensions = (200, 50)
print(dimensions[0]) #200
print(dimensions[1]) #50

#loop values in a tuple using a for loop
dimensions = (200, 50)
for dimension in dimensions: 
    print(dimension) #python will print dimensions in a tuple, like it would for a list
