#Python Crash Course: Chapter 4 Lists pg. 65/Slicing

#create list
books = ['Station Eleven',
         'Furiously Happy',
         'The Night Circus',
         'The Ghost Bride',
         'The Obelisk Gate']
print(books)

#print as unnumbered list
print(*books, sep = '\n')

#identify range of items to be slice. Here I will print the first three books on the list
print(books[0:3])

#print first three elements of list as unnumbered list
print(*books[0:3], sep = '\n')

#slice second, third and fourth items in a list
print(books[1:4])

#python automatically starts slice at the beginning of list if the first index is left out
print(books[:6])

#to print an index through the last item, leave off the final index in range but enter the starting index
print(books[2:])

#print slice as unnumbered list
print(*books[2:], sep = '\n')
