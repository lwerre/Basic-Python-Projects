#Python Crash Course: Chapter 4 Lists pg. 65/Slicing
#20190816 cleaned up lists to include descriptions before each slice and have each slice print as an unnumbered list

#create list
books = ['Station Eleven',
         'Furiously Happy',
         'The Night Circus',
         'The Ghost Bride',
         'The Obelisk Gate']
#print(books)--->I don't want the list to print in this format

#print as unnumbered list
print("Here is a list of books I want to read: ")
print(*books, sep = '\n')

#identify range of items to be slice. Here I will print the first three books in an unnumbered list format
print("The first three books on my to-read list are: ")
print(*books[0:3], sep = '\n')

#slice second, third and fourth items in a list
print("Here are the middle three books on my to-read list: ")
print(*books[1:4], sep = '\n')

#python automatically starts slice at the beginning of list if the first index is left out
print("Python automatically starts the slice at the beginning of the list if the first index is left out: ")
print(*books[:6], sep = '\n')

#to print an index through the last item, leave off the final index in range but enter the starting index
print("Python will print the third through the last item if the final index in range is left out: "
print(*books[2:], sep = '\n')

#need to figure out how to create spaces between each list
