#list five favorite books and store them as a TUPLE
books = ('The Thirteenth Tale', 
         'The Girl with All the Gifts',

#REMEMBER tuples are used when you want to store a set of values that cannot be changed throughout the life of the program

#use a FOR LOOP to print each of the books in the book list
for book in books:

#to make changes to a tuple, rewrite the tuple. Replace two of the books on the list and print each item on the revised menu
