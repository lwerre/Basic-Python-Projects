#return to the beginning of a loop based on the result of a conditional test

#begin the count at 0
current_number = 0
while current_number < 10:
    current_number += 1 #add to the resulting number in incriments of one
    if current_number % 2 == 0: #if the current number is divisible by 2, python will ignore it and continue to execute
        continue
    
    print(current_number) #this will print ONLY the odd numbers up until 10
