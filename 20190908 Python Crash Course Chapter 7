#20190908 Python Crash Course Chapter 7: pizza toppings loop exercise p. 127

prompt = "\nWhat kind of toppings would you like on your pizza?"
prompt += "\nEnter quit to end the list."

while True:
    pizza = input(prompt)
    
    if pizza == 'quit':
        break
    else:
        print(pizza.title() + "  will be added to your pizza.")
        #the spacing between the pizza topping and "will be added..." is weird. Will revisit in the morning to fix.
