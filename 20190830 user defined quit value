#20190830 Python Crash Course Chapter 7: allowing user to quit a while loop

#letting the user choose when to quit by defining a quit value
prompt = "\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to end the program."
#message ""value will loop whatever the user enters
message = " "

#following while loop runs as long as the message entered is not 'quit'
while message != 'quit':
    message = input(prompt)
   
    #prints the quit message at this point. Add an if test to fix.
    if message != 'quit':
        print(message)
