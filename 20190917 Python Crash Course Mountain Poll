#20190917 Python Crash Course Chapter 7: Filling a dictionary with user input page 130

#first, define an empty dictionary (call it 'responses')
responses = {}

#set a flag to indicate that the polling is active
polling_active = True

while polling_active:
    #prompt for user's name and response; make sure to indent
    name = input("\nWhat is your name? ")
    response = input("Which mountain would you like to climb someday?")

#store the response in the dictionary, responses = {}
responses[name] = response
#could be read as, in the dictionary named responses, make entry "name" equal the response input
#is anyone else going to take the poll? 
repeat = input("Would you like to have another person take the poll?" + "(yes/no) ")
#spyder 3 is not running while loop. Will troubleshoot tomorrow.

while repeat == 'no':
    polling_active = False

#if False, polling is complete, show results
print("\n--- Poll Results ---")
for name, response in responses.items():
    print(name + "would like to climb " + response + ".")
