#Python Crash Course Chapter 4: list of square numbers; ** = exponents
#put first 10 square numbers into a list
squares = [] #begin with empty list
for value in range(1, 11): #tell python to loop each value from 1-10 using range()
    square = value**2 #current value is raised to the second power
    squares.append(square) #each new value of the square is added to the list
print(squares)

#another way to write this code is: squares = [] / for value in range (1, 11): / squares.append(value**2)

#list comprehension combines for loop with element creations in one line of code
squares = [value**2 for value in range(1,11)]
print(squares)

cubed = [value**3 for value in range(1,11)]
print(cubed)

#Python Crash Course exercise 4.3: counting to twenty 
numbers = list(range(1,21))
print(numbers)

#for loop to print numbers 1-20, inclusive
numbers = []
for value in range(1,21):
    number = value **1
    numbers.append(number)
print(numbers)

#Python Crash Course 4.7: make a list of multiples of 3 from 3-30. Use a for loop to print numbers on list
threes = []
for value in range(3,31):
    three = value**3
    threes.append(three)
print(threes)

#Python Crash Course 4.9: use a list comprehension to generate a list of the first 10 cubes
cubes = [value**4 for value in range(1,11)]
print(cubes)
